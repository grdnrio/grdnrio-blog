I made some comments about the challenges that arise when hosting databases, in particular production databases, in a cloud environment. It was interesting to consider where the pain points would be with PaaS and IaaS, and the benefits and draw backs of each option.
 
> When executing your organisation’s database strategy it is important to consider whether this will be an IaaS or PaaS implementation. A decision between IaaS and PaaS will generally depend on the type of database and the expertise in the business, according to Joe Gardiner, product head at cloud hosting firm CatN
 
> “IaaS is becoming more and more commoditised so it can appear an inexpensive option. However, the expertise required to configure a scalable and resilient environment on IaaS for a production database are not to be underestimated and are rarely cheap,” says Gardiner.
