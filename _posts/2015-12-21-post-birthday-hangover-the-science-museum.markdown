The day after celebrating your birthday is always a little hazy, what better than a day trip to the Science Museum to get your mind working again! There’s nothing like a spontaneous day trip to cure a hangover on a seriously hot day.




We drove up to Wimbledon and caught the District Line up to South Kensington. This seemed like a good idea, however as everyone knows, the tube in Summer (if you can three days of sunshine Summer) is never fun, especially the incredibly slow District Line. Having said that it was cool going past Wimbledon Park and seeing all the campers in their tents for the Tennis.





I hadn’t been to the Science Museum for years and could only remember the escalator into the globe, which may in fact have been the Natural History Museum… The great thing about the Science Museum, Natural History, V&A and others is that they’re free. I think this is excellent, and it’s really important that these kind of institutes stay free. What could be more valuable than knowledge after all?





I had forgotten how great the Space section of the museum is. The fact they have numerous, actually used space craft hanging from the ceiling is really amazing. Of course there’s also the slightly creepy space suits…

Moving on from the Space section, I was most interested in the Computing and Mathematics displays. We had to go through the Engineering section which was amazing! Check out the old school computers / consoles.

We headed back to Wimbledon after the Science Museum for some dinner. I had eaten a great little Italian called Al Forno once before, and after calling Sandy for directions we found the place. My dinner was very good but unfortunately Jennie wasn’t quite as fond of hers. She looks pretty happy with it to me though!

It was a great birthday day trip so thanks Jennie, and cheers Daltons for a great Saturday piss up!
