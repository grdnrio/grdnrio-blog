As part of my [Open University](http://open.ac.uk) course I need to keep a record on my personal blog (or learning journal) of stories in the media featuring advances or changes in digital technology. These are the most interesting stories I came across over the week starting the 13th February 2012.




### Instagram Just Gave You One Less Reason To Use Camera+





The Instagram app available on iPhone and soon Android has had a new feature added called Lux. This new brightness setting continues to simplify the use of this camera app, and makes it even easier for amateur photographers to take good quality photos good enough to share.





Introducing this feature is another step away from the traditional manual, or now even digital, SLR cameras and takes advantage of the high quality, high resolution cameras built in to our mobile phones. This may seem like a small digital advancement, but it is an excellent example of digital consolidation, particularly when we look at hardware, and the commoditisation of devices that are connected to the internet.





As devices become more and more connected the simple function and app support is now the key issue for users / consumers, not the subtle differences between vendors that had an impact on the consumers purchasing decision in the past.

### SendHub





The SendHub service allows businesses, individuals and groups to send SMS messages for free. It is also free for the recipients of the messages. Offering this as a service without any large costs attached allows entities who in the past could not commercially justify an SMS announcement service to engage with their customers / clients more directly.





This allows socially important services such as teachers and health car workers to engage directly and regularly with potential at risk groups and offer advice and services directly.

### The Tesla Model X





Tesla have released a new hybrid SUV, fully electric car that, after tax relief and rebates, is affordable in the American car market. At $50,000 the price tag is high, however taking into account the price of fuel and the subsidies from the Government, it suddenly become achievable.





Perhaps this model will finally have mass appeal outside of the EV niche. Even if it doesnâ€™t it is a strong sign from Tesla that their intention is to make electric vehicles a real option for the general public, and to move away from specialising in sports car that some consider gimmicky.
