Great news. At long last I have finally managed to become a RHCE. It took a while, and four exams, but I made it!




Here are my results on the way to earning my RHCE…





RHCSA Exam 1: 133 out of 300   

 RHCSA Exam 2: 233 out of 300 PASS





RHCE Exam 1: 187 out of 300   

 RHCE Exam 2: 247 out of 300 PASS





… and my certificate number is: 111-127-981.





Happy days!
