Over the last few months I have been working with two business partners to get a new project off the ground. The project is called Brewly, and it is a home brew subscription service which makes brewing your own beer very simple and convenient.





Each month we will send our customers a branded box containing everything they need to brew their own: spray malt, sugar, hops (oil or dried, yet to be decided), and yeast. There is also the option to add a starter pack which will include a fermenting bucket, bottles and other paraphernalia. The starter pack is a one off purchase that can be used again and again with each month’s box.





I am taking the role of online / technical director and will be in charge off the website, promotional activities and the backend systems for hosting and payments. My business partners are the brewing experts and will be sourcing the best ingredients, coming up with delicious new brew recipes, and talking about the product in our promotional material. I’m not a beer expert yet but I’m <del>drinking</del> working hard at it.





At the moment you can register your interest in the service on the [Brewly signup page](http://brewly.co.uk). This will get you early access and a discount on your first box. The main website is currently in development and will hopefully be live by the end of the month. In the mean time here are some illustrations from the site to whet your appetite.

For updates about the project progress and when the service is available follow [@BrewlyBeer](http://twitter.com/brewlybeer) on Twitter. The website has been designed by ex-colleague and Trojan Airsoft team mate [Harry Ford](http://harryford.co.uk/), and the web development is by current colleague and Trojan Airsoft team mate [Steve Whitely](http://whtly.com/).





The service is going to launch at £15 per month with flexible delivery schedules. This price might change but we reckon it is great value when you look at the cost per pint and other similar services available. The starter kit will probably be close to £25 but this depends on our supplier deals which are still being sorted out.
