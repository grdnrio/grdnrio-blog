With a background in web hosting I am a technical product manager; I consider myself a techie first and product person second. I live with my family in Aldershot in the UK and am currently working as Head of Product at [CatN, a cloud hosting company](http://catn.com). CatN is part of Fubra limited, a company who build consumer websites.




I spend a lot of my time working to deliver services to Central Government via frameworks such as G-Cloud (1 – 4), and the Digital Services Framework. I have also pitched money saving ideas to government and commented on government IT changes. Here are some press mentions.

I am currently working with two business partners on our first start-up called Brewly. It is an online service that provides subscription home brew kits. We have simplified the traditionally complicated process of brewing your own beer and made it easily accessible for beginners. With a choice of three different beers each month it also provides lots of variety!





You can check out Brewly at [www.brewly.co.uk](http://brewly.co.uk).
