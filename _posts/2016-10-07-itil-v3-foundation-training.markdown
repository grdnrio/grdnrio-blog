This weekend I will be undertaking [ITIL v3 Foundation](http://www.itil-officialsite.com/Qualifications/ITILQualificationLevels/ITILFoundation.aspx) training in Reading (at a go-kart centre!).




The aim is to improve my service delivery management skills, and improve my knowledge of best practice around documentation such as an SLA.





I hope to better understand the service lifecycle, an to put that understanding into practice when dealing with our large CatN clients and, hopefully, Central government.





**UPDATE:** During the excellent training with Smatra, we had a Saturday lunch time Go-Karting session. Here is the video.
