A couple of months ago I got back to thinking about where I’d like to be, not only career wise, but personally in a few years time. It’s incredible how my vision for the future has matured and developed as life has changed! I came to the conclusion that it was time for a change, with my second child now 8 months old and family life pretty settled, more specifically a career change.

I’ve been thinking about what I enjoy most about my role as General Manager at CatN: meeting with (potential) clients. More specifically I love that ‘eureka moment’ when the client sees the potential benefits that cloud technology will deliver. I’m a passionate technologist, and bouncing ideas around is great fun!

So, I’m delighted to announce that I’ll be leaving CatN and joining hosting behemoth Rackspace as a Cloud Mentor. I’m going to be working as part of the customer success team to design and deliver cloud solutions, but most importantly to unlock the potential of cloud infrastructure and platform in the client’s business and strategic thinking.

I’m incredibly excited about this new role. The culture at Rackspace is stuff of legend, and I have the opportunity to flex my strategic and tactical muscles in a single role. Most importantly I get to work with some incredibly talented people in a forward thinking, technology leader, and to develop professionally.
