The BBC aired a great documentary about the LP a few nights ago. It was on BBC Four and is [available here](http://bbc.in/WWCBvo) although I’m not sure how long this link will survive!




The program was not only an excellently paced documentary about the lasting impact of the LP, it was also full of some really excellent music, a lot of which was played by my parents in my childhood.





I couldn’t find a list of the tracks anywhere online so I decided to make a playlist from the albums featured in the program. Not every single album is here, however when an album is spoken about in detail I have added it. Also please note that I have made a subjective choice about the best tracks to include ![:)](http://joegardiner.co.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png) (two from each album.)
