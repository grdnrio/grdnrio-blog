I had a great idea earlier to trawl through the London 2012 Closing Ceremony video, take note of all the songs and put together a Spotify playlist to share with the world. I had a dream, a great Olympic related musical dream. Unfortunately Spotify, the makers of Spotify, got there first. Well played Spotify I salute you.




So instead of duplicating their excellent work I’m going to rip it off shamelessly. Here’s the damn playlist for you…







I hope you didn’t enjoy that too much…
