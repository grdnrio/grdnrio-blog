I made some comments about selecting a hosting service for an e-commerce website. They were published on Tech Radar.

> Coupled with this is the service level agreement (SLA) that supports the e-commerce servers in use, as Joe Gardiner, head of hosting at CatN, explains: “Make sure you have real people providing expert support. No IT system can be perfect and things will always go wrong at some stage, normally at a peak time. Knowing that you have a responsive, expert team that you can contact 24/7 is vital, especially in e-commerce where a minute of downtime can cost a lot of money.

> “It’s also important to make sure that the system encompasses integration options, such as secure credit card transactions, credit checks and so on, and that it enables you to migrate away flexibly.”

Taken from the article [How to choose the right server for your e-commerce site](http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/servers/how-to-choose-the-right-server-for-your-e-commerce-site-1176935) on Techradar.com.
